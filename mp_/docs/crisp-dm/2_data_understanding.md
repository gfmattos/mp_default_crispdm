# **II. Data Understanding**

## **● Initial data collection**

    • What data will we collect?
    • How often will we collect this data?
    • What is the difficulty of accessing this data?
    • Will we use any tools for understanding the data?
    • Will we need data from distinct fonts/areas?If so, how do they relate?Do we really need all the data we are requesting?
    • If we can't everyone, what are crucial for our analysis?

## **● Data description**

    The next slide must describe its requirements and explain in some details exactly which data the group has gathered and from which sources.Here, you confirm that you really got the data.If there were difficulties, explain which and how they approached them (using alternative sources, reviewing plans, changing formats).

## **● Exploring the data**

    • Are there correlations between data?If so, what type and what type?
    • What hypotheses this data mass raises?
    • Can any information extracted can change the direction of the project?
    • Any analysis suggests attention in any detail?

## **● Data Quality**

    • Are the data complete?
    • How clean/dirty is the pasta collected?
    • Did the mass have a problem like empty or null spaces?
    • What are the possible solutions to the above problem?
    • Any error in data representation?
    • Does the mass involve measuring units?Is attention to this needed?
